### MOB MOVEMENT ###

## We suggest editing these variabled in-game to find a good speed for your server. To do this you must be a high level admin. Open the 'debug' tab ingame. Select "Debug Controller" and then, in the popup, select "Configuration". These variables should have the same name.

## These values get directly added to values and totals in-game. To speed things up make the number negative, to slow things down, make the number positive.

## The variables below affect the movement of specific mob types.
HUMAN_DELAY 0
ROBOT_DELAY 0
MONKEY_DELAY 0
ALIEN_DELAY 0
ANIMAL_DELAY 0


### Miscellaneous ###

## Config options which, of course, don't fit into previous categories.

## Remove the # in front of this config option to have loyalty implants spawn by default on your server.
#USE_LOYALTY_IMPLANTS
