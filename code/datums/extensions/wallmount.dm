/*
	This file contains a selection of helper functions to mount an atom onto a wall or similar dense object

	Some basic rules:
		mounted atoms can face a cardinal or diagonal direction.
		mounted atoms can be mounted onto any wall, or dense atom
		mounted atoms must face away from the thing they are mounted on, by at least 135 degree angle


	Most of these helpers work with locations and directions, rather than with an actual atom being passed.
	This is done to accomodate virtual checking, as used in placement datums where the atom hasn't been spawned yet
