/*
    This extension coordinates physical presence for atoms larger than a single tile in size.

    This only applies to collision box. Not visuals.
    Plenty of things extend outside their tile visually but still only have 1x1 collision

	This extension makes a few assumptions
		-Only width and height are supported, no x and y offsets
		-All width and height values are in multiples of WORLD_ICON_SIZE. No remainder
		-Bounding boxes are rectangular and convex in shape
		-Only 2D bounding boxes are supported for now. No creatures spanning multiple zlevels yet
