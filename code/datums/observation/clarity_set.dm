//	Observer Pattern Implementation: Clarity Set
//		Registration type: /turf
//
//		Raised when: The total number of dense nonmob atoms in a turf's self+contents changes between zero and nonzero. This is primarily useful for vine and visualnet updating
//		It is less certain, but more comprehensive, than density set. Firing off an event whenever anything could possibly happen to catch all cases and eliminate the need to poll things
//
//		Clarity set event is intended to be paired with turf_clear() to get a comprehensive measure of whether the turf is blocked.
//		This proc is not run automatically, call it on demand if you want to know for sure.
//
//		Arguments that the called proc should expect:
//			/atom/clarity_changer: The instance that changed clarity.
