	description = "A pristine blade used for religious ceremonies in the Church of Unitology.\
	  Mechanically, it has the same stats as an ordinary boot knife, but it has two important special features. <br>\
	  <br>\
	  1. While held in hand, the blade unlocks the unique Sacrifice execution move, allowing ritual murder of a human without head protection. <br>\
	  A human sacrificed in this manner is worth more biomass when the necromorphs get to them later.<br>\
	  Requires the victim to remain still, so best restrain them first. The ritual takes wquite a while, giving you ample opportunity for a short speech<br>\
	  Please note that simply owning this knife does not make you an antag, and you shouldn't be murdering humans if you aren't an antagonist.<br>\
	  <br>\
	  2. While equipped, both in your loadout at roundstart, and your inventory during the round, this blade gives an extra 15% chance to be picked for unitology antagonist roles.<br>\
	  This effect does not override your preferences, if you have unitologists set to never then you still won't be picked"
