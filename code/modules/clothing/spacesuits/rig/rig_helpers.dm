/*
	This proc has two goals:

	1. To transfer over all possible rig modules from source to target
		-Where there are conflicting module series (like normal and advanced kinesis),
			the target rig will end up with the superior option of the two, and the inferior one placed in source


	2. To replace source with target.
		-In most use cases, source will start off worn by a human.
			So the source will be undeployed and unequipped, then target will be equipped and deployed on that same mob

	All parameters are optional except target
		If no source is passed, we're transferring loose modules into a rig
		If no user is passed, we take user from source if possible, in order to do equipping
		extra_modules is a list of loose modules which we will attempt to install into target
			in either case, any leftover modules will go into source if possible
		dump is the place that leftover modules go after that. If none is provided they'll be dropped on the ground somewhere
