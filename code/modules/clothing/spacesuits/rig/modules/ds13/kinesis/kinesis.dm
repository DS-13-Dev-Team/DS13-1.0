	Click handler recieving procs

/*
	This proc is called for two scenarios/purposes

	1. If we're already holding something, this tells us that the user has moved their mouse,
	giving us a new place to move the held item towards. We will update our clickpoint, unset at_rest, etc.

	2. When we're not holding anything, this is called when the user attempts to grab something
	In this case, we will look around the original clickpoint to determine what they might have been trying to click on.
	Once we find the most likely candidate, we will attempt to grab it
*/
/*Arguments:
	A: What the user clicked on. We'll search around it.
	user: Self explanatory, we know who they are so we'll ignore this
	adjacent: Irrelevant to us
	Params: Click params from the mouse action which caused this update, vitally important
	global clickpoint: Where the user clicked in world pixel coords
