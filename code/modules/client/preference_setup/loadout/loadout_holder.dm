/*
	/datum/extension/loadout is a datum which acts as an umbrella to handle all the things a human will wear just before spawning in.

	It is typically stored on a mob after it is created, where it can be populated with more data before it is applied.
	Typically, it will be deleted after applying to a mob spawned into the world

	Loadout holders are not serialized. They are created at runtime to hold gear loaded from disk

	It is comprised of two main components:
	1. Outfit. Typically taken from the assigned job, a baseline outfit is retrieved and copied into here. It must be copied
	because it will be edited

	2. Gear datums, IE the usual loadout stuff.

	Before anything is put onto the player, these two types of things are gathered and mixed, they work out their differences.
	Typically, gear datums take precedence, and may disable or displace parts of the outfit

	This datum also validates the gear, making sure the user isn't trying to take two rigs, two pairs of shoes, or
	patron items when they're not a patron

	After the mixing is done, then the whole loadout is equipped onto the player in this order:,
		1. modified-outfit
		2. gear datums
		3. Stored items
