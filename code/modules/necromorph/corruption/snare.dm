/*
	The snare node is a necromorph trap. It will attempt to trip a human who walks over it. This is not luck based though.
	If successful, the human is knocked down for a significant period, and all the necromorphs are alerted to the location.
	Snares are single use and delete themselves on a successful trip

	Snare is avoidable, quite easily. If a player interacts with it in any manner to indicate that they've noticed it, they become immune
	to that particular snare for several minutes.

	It's main design goal is to act as a chilling effect. To force crew players to slow down and pay attention to their environment
