/*
	A wave is a special kind of multi-part projectile, made of several smaller projectiles

	By default, a target can only be damaged once by the whole wave. The additional projectiles provide coverage, not multiplied damage

	One of the projectiles is designated the master of the wave, and this is the only one which typically has a visual representation.
	Large enough to cover fro the others
	The master is responsible for adjusting its visuals to represent projectiles that are lost

	Any projectile may be lost from the wave. If one is lost from somewhere in the middle which results in the wave no longer being cardinally connected,
	then the wave will split into two smaller waves

	Some projectiles are designated as backstops. They are extras created to fill gaps when the main projectiles do not connect cardinally.
	Backstops cannot become master projectiles, and will be deleted if they are orphaned into a wave with no normal projectiles
