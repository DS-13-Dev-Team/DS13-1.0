	Signal abilities are "spells" that can be used by signals, and the marker, while in their observer modes.

	Almost all signal abilities can only be cast upon tiles visible to the necrovision network.
	Many, more restrictive ones, can only be cast upon corrupted tiles. And often only when not visible to humans
