/*
	High leap, a long distance attack ability.
	The user jumps into the air, briefly going offscreen and untargetable, before landing at the target point

	A jump happens in four stages:
		Windup: We compress and push off from the ground. Sleep and then immediately call launch
		Launch: We leave the ground and start travelling to the destination. Calculate when we should land and schedule for then
		Landing: We drop in from above and land on the ground. Sleep and then immediately call wind down
		Wind down: We recover from landing
