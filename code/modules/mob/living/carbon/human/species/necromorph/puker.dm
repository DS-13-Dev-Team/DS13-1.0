#define PUKER_PASSIVE	"<h2>PASSIVE: Corrosive Vengeance:</h2><br>\
When the puker loses a limb, a wave of acid spurts out in all directions, dousing nearby people. This can hurt other necromorphs, so don't stand too close to allies."

#define PUKER_PASSIVE_2	"<h2>PASSIVE: Eyeless Horror:</h2><br>\
Constant exposure to corrosion has long since burned out its eyes, and the puker has learned to cope without them.<br>\
As a result, puker is not blinded if its head is cut off. However, losing its head will affect the vomit ability."

#define PUKER_PASSIVE_3	"<h2>PASSIVE: Crippling Acid:</h2><br>\
All of your abilities douse the victims in acid, which slows their movement speed by 30% as long as its on them."


#define PUKER_SNAP_DESC	"<h2>Snapshot:</h2><br>\
<h3>Hotkey: Middle Click </h3><br>\
<h3>Cooldown: 3 seconds</h3><br>\
Fires an instant autoaimed shot at a target within a 6 tile range, dealing 17.5 burn damage on hit. <br>\
In addition, it douses the victim in acid, dealing up to 17.5 additional burn damage over time <br>\
<br>\
This ability will harmlessly pass over other necromorphs.<br>\
Snapshot requires no manual aiming at all, and is thusly great to use in the middle of a chaotic brawl, to deal extra damage to humans who are already in melee"


#define PUKER_LONGSHOT_DESC "<h2>Long Shot:</h2><br>\
<h3>Hotkey: Alt+Click</h3><br>\
After a half-second windup, Fires a long ranged unguided bolt of acid, dealing 35 burn damage on hit<br>\
In addition, it douses the victim in acid, dealing up to 35 additional burn damage over time <br>\
Long shot is powerful and has no cooldown, but is easily dodged<br>\

This ability will harmlessly pass over other necromorphs.<br>\
Best used for harassment, skirmishing and initiating fights from afar against unwary targets"

#define PUKER_VOMIT_DESC "<h2>Vomit:</h2><br>\
<h3>Hotkey: Ctrl+Alt+Click</h3><br>\
After a 1 second windup, the Puker starts vomiting a vast torrent of acid, dousing all tiles in a 4-tile long cone over 3.5 seconds<br>\
The puker is unable to move while vomiting, but you can move your mouse to rotate on the spot and aim it in different directions. <br>\
In addition to splashing on any creatures within the radius, the floor is covered in acid for a long time afterwards, which will be soaked up by any non-necromorph that walks on it<br>\
The acid splashed on floors will accumulate without limit, repeatedly vomiting will make a larger, longer-lasting patch of acid. It will dry up eventually if left alone though. <br>\
If the puker has been decapitated, the range of vomit is significantly reduced.<br>\

Vomit is an extremely powerful signature ability, useful to decimate vast crowds of victims, and deny access to a broad area.<br>\
Be warned that friendly fire is fully active, it can harm other necromorphs as much as your enemies."
