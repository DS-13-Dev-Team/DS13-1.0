/*
	The hunter can be thought of as a mini ubermorph, It has some of the same powers, including regeneration,
	though generally to a lower degree

	The hunter is not completely immortal, but it is hard to kill. When its health is reduced to zero, it is simply stunned for
	a significant period, not killed.

	More advanced tactics are needed to kill it, There are three main ways:
		1. Fire. A certain total quantity of burn damage suffered (in addition to being at 0 health generally) will kill it.
			Any kind of burn damage counts for this purpose. Fire, explosions, acid, lasers, etc.

		2. Lasting damage: The hunter can build up lasting damage like any other necro. If it builds up enough to reduce its max HP to zero, then it will die

		3. Exile: Launch it into space, or otherwise off the map

The Hunter cannot be killed by normal means. When its health is reduced to zero, it will not die, but instead just be stunned for a long while<br>\

The hunter can only die when one of the following is true<br>\
	1. It sustains total burn damage greater than [CUMULATIVE_BURN_DAMAGE * 100]% of its max health.<br>\
	2. It sustains enough lasting damage to reduce its max health to nothing<br>\
	3. It is launched out of the map, off the edge of space<br>\
In addition, the Hunter passively regenerates 2 health per second."

#define HUNTER_PASSIVE_2	"<h2>PASSIVE: False Death:</h2><br>\
When the hunter's health drops to 0, it does not die, but instead falls unconscious for 15 seconds. <br>\
If it is still alive at the end of this time period, it immediately heals 100 damage, and regrows two missing limbs.<br>\
This effect has a cooldown of 2 minutes"

#define HUNTER_REGENERATE_DESC	"<h2>Regenerate:</h2><br>\
<h3>Cooldown: 30 seconds</h3><br>\
The Hunter starts shaking and screaming in pain, as it regrows a missing limb and heals 30 health, over a period of 8 seconds.<br>\
 This also heals 20 lasting damage. The hunter's regenerate is much less effective against burn damage, healing it at only 33% of the normal rate."


#define HUNTER_LUNGE_DESC	"<h2>Hookblade:</h2><br>\
<h3>Hotkey: Alt+Click </h3><br>\
The hunter springs forwards up to two tiles, and swings its claws in a wide arc. Any victims hit will suffer 15 damage, and be pulled in"

<h3>Hotkey: Ctrl+Alt+Click</h3><br>\
<h3>Duration: up to 5 minutes</h3><br>\
<h3>Cooldown: 30 seconds</h3><br>\
With a bloody roar, the hunter draws attention of nearby foes, making it hard for them to focus on his allies. <br>\
The hunter himself recieves 15% incoming damage reduction and 20% bonus movespeed while taunt is active.<br>\
Other necromorphs he sees, instead gain 30% incoming damage reduction and 10% evasion.<br>\
This support buff is added and removed as necromorphs enter and leave his view, not just at the start.<br>\
<br>\
Taunt has a very long possible duration, but it will terminate early if the hunter is knocked down, or goes for six seconds without seeing an enemy stand against him."
