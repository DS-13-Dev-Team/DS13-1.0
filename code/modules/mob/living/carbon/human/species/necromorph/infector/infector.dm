#define INFECTOR_PASSIVE_1	"<h2>PASSIVE: Necrotoxin:</h2><br>\
The infector's attacks, both melee and ranged, inject the victim with Necrotoxin, which slowly deals damage over time. \n\
If this poison kills the victim, they will automatically be reanimated as a necromorph shortly after death. \n\
Note that this effect only happens if the victim slowly dies of poison, death by other causes will prevent it."

#define INFECTOR_PASSIVE_2	"<h2>PASSIVE: Essence:</h2><br>\
The infector stores up a special resource called Essence over time. This is used to trigger some of its special abilities. \n\
One point is generated per minute"





#define INFECTOR_FLAP_DESC 	"<h2>Flap:</h2><br>\
<h3>Hotkey: Alt+Click </h3><br>\
<h3>Cooldown: 3 seconds</h3><br>\
The Infector flaps its wings to generate lift, allowing it to get a short distance off the ground and glide towards the target point. \n\
This is much faster than walking around, though trickier to control. \n\
If one of its wings is missing, flap is penalised in accuracy and cooldown. If both wings are missing, this ability is disabled."

#define INFECTOR_STING_DESC "<h2>Venomous Sting:</h2><br>\
<h3>Hotkey: Middle Click</h3><br>\
<h3>Cooldown: 10 seconds</h3><br>\
The infector fires a quick spine, which applies necrotoxin on hit. Has a long cooldown between uses, as the infector is not a frontline combatant"

#define INFECTOR_PARASITE_DESC "<h2>Execution: Parasite Leap:</h2><br>\
<h3>Hotkey: Ctrl+Shift+Click</h3><br>\
<h3>Cooldown: 1 minute</h3><br>\
An elaborate finishing move performed on a standing victim. The infector wraps around the target, clinging on tight as it attempts to probe their skull.\n\
It will take some time to complete, depending on the victim's head protection, and the infector is very vulnerable to grappling while attempting this.\n\
If this technique is successful, not only will the victim be killed, but they will be immediately converted into a necromorph, with a higher chance to get more powerful options."

#define INFECTOR_ESSENCE_DESC	"<h2>Essence Ability:</h2><br>\
<h3>Hotkey: Ctrl+Alt+Click </h3><br>\
This hotkey combo activates your currently selected essence ability. These abilities consume Essence, a resource that recharges over time. Be sure to select it with the verb in the Necromorph tab first.\n\
Unless otherwise noted, all abilities are touch-range only, and can only affect something adjacent to you.\n\
\
\
\
<h3>Reanimate:</h3><br>\
Converts the target corpse into a randomly selected necromorph. Slashers are most common, but other options are possible depending on a variety of esoteric factors.\
Fresher, more intact corpses, of higher ranking crewmembers or antagonists, give better conversion results. A head is required.\
\
<h3>Mend:</h3><br>\
Repairs a target necromorph, consuming essence each second to restore their health\
\
<h3>Engorge:</h3><br>\
Makes the targeted necromorph larger, increasing its health, movespeed and view range. This effect is permanant but does not stack\
\
<h3>Forming:</h3><br>\
A series of abilities that use essence to create new corruption nodes. Only a small part of the cost is paid up front to start the construction\
The rest is paid over time while working on it. Other infectors can assist, spending their own essence.\
All of them except New Growth require corruption to build upon\
