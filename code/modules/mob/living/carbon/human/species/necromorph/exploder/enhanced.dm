#define EXPLODER_ENHANCED_PASSIVE	"<h2>PASSIVE: Burning Acid Pustule:</h2><br>\
The Exploder's arm is a massive pustule full of flammable chemicals, which can create a devastating explosion when triggered.<br>\
The surrounding area is showered in superheated acid and shards of bone, delivering hell to anything nearby. This has major friendly fire potential so be aware of your allies<br>\
The pustule is fairly fragile, and can be detonated by a fairly minor quantity of damage aimed at it, so it is vitally important to avoid gunfire while approaching enemies.<br>\
<br>\
The pustule does NOT automatically detonate on death, and if the exploder's left arm is severed, the pustule can fall off without exploding."

#define EXPLODER_ENHANCED_PASSIVE_2	"<h2>PASSIVE: Burning Lightbearer:</h2><br>\
The Exploder pustule glows brightly, providing a source of blood-red light all around him.<br>\
If the exploder successfully detonates its pustule, the area around where he died is revealed to necrovision for 30 seconds post-death."

#define EXPLODER_ENHANCED_CHARGE_DESC	"<h2>Charge:</h2><br>\
<h3>Hotkey: Ctrl+Alt+Click </h3><br>\
<h3>Cooldown: 20 seconds</h3><br>\
The user screams for a few seconds, then runs towards the target at high speed, faster than a normal exploder. If they successfully hit a human, the explosive pustule detonates immediately.<br>\
A successful charge is the most effective and reliable way to detonate. It should be considered the prime goal of the exploder."


#define EXPLODER_ENHANCED_EXPLODE_DESC "<h2>Explode:</h2><br>\
<h3>Hotkey: Ctrl+Shift+Click</h3><br>\
The last resort. The exploder screams and shakes violently for 3 seconds, before detonating the pustule.<br>\
 This is quite telegraphed and it can give your victims time to back away before the explosion. Not the most ideal way to detonate, but it can be a viable backup if you fail to hit something with charge."
