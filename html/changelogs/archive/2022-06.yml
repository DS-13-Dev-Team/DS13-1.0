  - refactor: Refactored lighting system. Now we use tg lighting without movables
      system.
  - rscadd: Added directional lights (used for flashlights for now). Thanks Nebula
      for those.
  - refactor: Camera and Suit monitoring apps now use TGUI.
  - refactor: Refactored open spaces to use visual contents instead of what we used
      (AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!). Thanks to /tg/ for the code.

      now.
