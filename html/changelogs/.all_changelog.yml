2020-04-05:
  Nanako:
  - rscadd: The Marker, currently-posessed necromorphs, and signals now each have
      their own chat style in necrochat, prioritised in that order, so it's easier
      to tell who's speaking.
  - tweak: Admins can now read and mute necrochat
  - rscadd: Implemented the Puker, a brand new Tier 2 ranged necromorph. Puker is
      slow, but a flexible fighter and effective at all ranges
  - tweak: All necromorph acid attacks now slow the movespeed of their victims while
      coating the body. This currently applies to spitter, puker, and cysts
  - tweak: Slightly reduced necromorph limb health.
  - soundadd: Added firing audio for cyst corruption nodes.
  - rscadd: Charging attacks now have a motion blur effect
  - bugfix: Fixed a variety of animation bugs with leap, step-strike, basic attack
      animations, and windups for various abilities

      a charge attack.
  - bugfix: Sawblades can no longer be worn on the ear
  - bugfix: Plasma cutter ammo clips now take much less backpack space
  - bugfix: Randomly generated names are now sane and normal, instead of being a mishmash
      of syllables

      and the Bridge.

2020-04-11:
  Nanako:
  - bugfix: Fixed necrochat randomly breaking.
  - rscadd: Necromorph acid can now damage clothing. Any acid that doesn't reach the
      skin will splash onto worn equipment instead, gradually eating through it. As
      equipment takes damage, it lets more chemicals through. Items can also be damaged
      enough to be completely destroyed. This effect applies to all sources of acid.
      Puker, Spitter, Cysts
  - tweak: Biosuits and labcoats are now extremely resistant to acid.
  - tweak: Guns are now immune to acid, and won't melt.
  - tweak: Tools now take damage from acid instead of just melting outright.
  - tweak: Acid patches on the ground now only cause damage above a certain visibility.
      No more taking damage from acid you can hardly see. Examining the patch will
      tell whether or not its safe to walk on.
  - bugfix: Fixed puker acid patches not drying up over time
  - bugfix: Acid pools can no longer be pulled around.
  - rscadd: Added a massive new system for abilities that can be used by signals and
      markers, found in the Abilities tab. Abilities cost Psi Energy which is passively
      gained over time, and have an extremely broad range of functions. Many more
      abilities will be added in future.
  - tweak: Nerfed cyst damage a bit. There will be a lot more of them around now.
  - tweak: Buffed starting biomass.
  - imageadd: Implemented the Vintage rig, with sprites by Mr Mann. The vintage rig
      is an extremely bulky antique suit that significantly slows the user, but provides
      a ton of protection and a few useful modules. Both Chief Engineer, Director
      of Mining and Captain get a copy of the vintage rig
  - rscadd: Added the healthbar rig module, which displays the user's health in a
      meter along their spine. The healthbar is standard equipment in all rigs.
  Snypehunter007:
  - bugfix: Fixed Research design options missing their names.e

  - tweak: Reduced the disturbed burn wound pain multiplier, from 0.5 to 0.3

      will deal damage more slowly
  - bugfix: Fixed corruption stacking up on ladders and lagging out the server.
