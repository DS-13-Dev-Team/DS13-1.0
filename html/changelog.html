				<li class="tweak">Enhanced slasher biomass cost reduced from 175 to 150</li>

				<li class="experiment">The Marker's activation time has been delayed. It will now activate somewhere in the region of 38 to 51 minutes into the round</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Necromorph corpses will now vanish when they have been fully reclaimed by the marker. But only when noone is looking....</li>

				<li class="tweak">Reduced the disturbed burn wound pain multiplier, from 0.5 to 0.3</li>

				<li class="bugfix">Fixed necrochat randomly breaking.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Necromorph acid can now damage clothing. Any acid that doesn't reach the skin will splash onto worn equipment instead, gradually eating through it.

				<li class="bugfix">Acid pools can no longer be pulled around.</li>

				<li class="tweak">Nerfed cyst damage a bit. There will be a lot more of them around now.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Buffed starting biomass.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">Implemented the Vintage rig, with sprites by Mr Mann. The vintage rig is an extremely bulky antique suit that significantly slows the user, but provides a ton of protection and a few useful modules. Both Chief Engineer, Director of Mining and Captain get a copy of the vintage rig</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added the healthbar rig module, which displays the user's health in a meter along their spine. The healthbar is standard equipment in all rigs.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">The Marker, currently-posessed necromorphs, and signals now each have their own chat style in necrochat, prioritised in that order, so it's easier to tell who's speaking.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Implemented the Puker, a brand new Tier 2 ranged necromorph. Puker is slow, but a flexible fighter and effective at all ranges</li>
